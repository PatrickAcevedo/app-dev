**fallout movie**

The fallout movie is a good movie with some inconsistency. I love how they depicted some of the locations that the game shown. It made a realistic approach to the fictional game universe. They added a lot of in game items into our reality such as but not limited to:

1. Nuclear Fusion
2. Portable Computers
3. Portable Enrgy Device
